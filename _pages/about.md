I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Language Science](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine, where I work with professors [Noga Zaslavsky](https://www.nogsky.com/) and [Richard Futrell](https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/).

Before coming to Irvine, I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned a B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

<!-- I study how various internal and external pressures shape our representations of the world, from the level of our vocabularies to that of scientific research programs. At the level of cognitive systems, I use evolutionary models to explain why our semantic categories are structured the way they are. At the level of scientific communities, I conduct large scale, data-driven analyses of publishing behavior. My research is broadly unified by the goal of understanding how people transfer and process information. -->

I am interested in the various internal and external pressures that shape human languages. To this end, most of my published work focuses on how computational principles can explain empirically observed constraints on linguistic meaning. Ultimately, I'm interested in understanding how people transfer information efficiently -- not just at the level of the vocabulary, but at the level of naturalistic, socially-grounded language use.

Here is my [cv](../files/nathaniel_imel_cv.pdf).
