I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine.

I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned a B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

I'm interested in understanding communication and information processing, in individuals and communities, for both natural and artificial agents. I hope to draw on frameworks from linguistics, machine learning and philosophy to

* address scientific questions about language and cognition
* make progress towards safe artificial intelligence
* assist knowledge workers (e.g., journalists, teachers, scholars)

To this end, some of the questions I’m interested in include:

* What cognitive and cultural pressures shape human languages?
* Can understanding them help us guide artificial agents towards optimal communicative behavior?
* How do various information processing mechanisms constrain scientific inquiry?
* Can we harness these facts to build technology that helps people to do research efficiently?

Below is my CV.
