I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine.

I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned a B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

I'm interested in understanding efficient communication and information processing in humans and machines. In particular, my aim is to draw on frameworks from linguistics, machine learning and social epistemology to

* illuminate scientific questions about language and cognition
* make progress towards safe artificial intelligence
* assist knowledge workers (e.g., journalists, teachers, scholars) navigating their research landscape

Some of the questions I’m interested in include:

* What pressures shape human languages?
* Can these pressures help us guide AIs towards optimal and safe communication?
* How does human information processing shape scientific inquiry?
* Can we harness these facts to build technology that helps researchers communicate?

For more information about my research, see the CV section of this page.
