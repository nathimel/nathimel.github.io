I'm an first year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine. I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned my B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

I'm interested in information processing in humans and machines.
