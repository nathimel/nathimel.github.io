I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Language Science](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine.

Before coming to Irvine, I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned a B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

I study how social dynamics shape our representations of the world, from the level of our vocabularies to that of scientific research programs. At the level of cognitive systems, I use evolutionary models to explain why our semantic categories are structured the way they are. At the level of scientific communities, I conduct large scale, data-driven analyses of publishing behavior. My research is broadly unified by the goal of understanding how people transfer and process information.
