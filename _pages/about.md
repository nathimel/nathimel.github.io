I'm a Ph.D. student in Psychology ([Cognition and Perception](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/psychology/graduate/phd-cognition-perception.html)) at New York University, where I'm advised by [Noga Zaslavsky](https://www.nogsky.com/).


I'm interested in the principles that underlie our ability to efficiently represent the world and to communicate these representations to other minds. My projects have focused on:
- how pressure for communicative efficiency can explain variation in [semantic typology](https://nathimel.github.io/publication/3_modals-effcomm-salt),
- how such efficiency might [emerge](https://nathimel.github.io/publication/1_ibsg) from generic evolutionary dynamics,
- and how optimal compression might shape how people learn [concepts](https://nathimel.github.io/publication/0_ocm).

Before coming to NYU, I spent time at UC Irvine in the departments of [Language Science](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/) and [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu/). Before that I earned an M.S. in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, working with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/) at the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st/) lab. Before that I earned a B.A. in philosophy at UC San Diego.

<!-- I study how various internal and external pressures shape our representations of the world, from the level of our vocabularies to that of scientific research programs. At the level of cognitive systems, I use evolutionary models to explain why our semantic categories are structured the way they are. At the level of scientific communities, I conduct large scale, data-driven analyses of publishing behavior. My research is broadly unified by the goal of understanding how people transfer and process information. -->
