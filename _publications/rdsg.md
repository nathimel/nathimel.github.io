### Abstract

Converging evidence suggests that natural language meaning systems are *efficient* by jointly maximizing cognitive simplicity and communicative informativeness. Comparatively less is known about how languages might *optimize* over time for communicative efficiency. Our goal in this paper is to use minimal dynamic models to give a high-level description of the evolution of efficient meaning systems. To do this, we provide a model of emergent communication combining evolutionary game theory with a recent information theoretic account of efficiency in semantic systems. We perform simulations of adaptive dynamics requiring minimal assumptions about agentsâ€™ cognitive resources, and observe that emergent languages converge near the achievable bounds of efficient compression. This unifies existing accounts of communicative efficiency with minimalist accounts of how meaning can emerge *ex nihilo*.
