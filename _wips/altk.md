### Summary

ALTK is a software library that aims to support research in Unnatural Language Semantics -- a program in linguistics and cognitive science that tries to describe and explain the properties of natural languages by comparing them to the much larger set of mathematically possible languages.

A current focus is on efficient communication: determining whether linguistic meanings are optimized for a trade-off between cognitive complexity and communicative precision.

ALTK is still in development.
