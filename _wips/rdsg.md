### Abstract

Converging evidence suggests that natural language meaning systems are subject to an efficiency constraint: maximizing simplicity and informativeness (Kemp et al., 2018). It remains less clear how languages optimize for efficiency over time. Towards illuminating these dynamic aspects of efficient communication, we provide a model grounded in evolutionary game theory. We consider a similarity-maximizing signaling game in which a Sender and Receiver evolve to communicate about a richly structured meaning space, and perform simulations of adaptive dynamics that require minimal rationality assumptions about agents. We show that emergent languages converge near the achievable bounds of efficient compression given by Rate-Distortion Theory. This unifies static, information-theoretic accounts of communicative efficiency with dynamic, evolutionary accounts of how meaning can emerge ex nihilo in biological systems.
