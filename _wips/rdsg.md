### Abstract

Humans speak only a subset of the logically possible lan- guages. In the domain of semantics, growing evidence sug- gests that natural language meaning systems are subject to an efficiency constraint: maximizing simplicity and informative- ness. Under what general conditions can we expect such mean- ing systems to emerge? This paper presents an evolutionary game-theoretic model of efficient communication to address this question. I consider a similarity-maximizing (sim-max) signaling game in which Sender and Receiver evolve to com- municate about a richly structured meaning space. In sim- ulations of Roth-Erev reinforcement learning and a discrete- time replicator dynamic, I show that languages converge near the achievable bounds of efficient compression given by Rate- Distortion Theory. This suggests a concrete connection be- tween the information-theoretic efficiency of meaning systems and their stability in evolution.
